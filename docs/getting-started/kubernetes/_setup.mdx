### Add the ngrok Helm chart

```bash
helm repo add ngrok https://charts.ngrok.com
helm repo update
```

:::note
Whenever you want to update the operator or install a new version, you must run `helm repo update` to fetch the latest charts.

### Get your ngrok API key and authtoken

You can get both these from the ngrok dashboard:

- Your [authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken)
- An [API key](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/api)

These credentials will be created as a Kubernetes secret, which the controller will have access to.
The authtoken is used to create tunnels, and the API key is used to manage resources via the ngrok API.

```bash
export NGROK_AUTHTOKEN=your copied auth token goes here
export NGROK_API_KEY=your copied api key goes here
```

### Select your namespace

Set the following variable to whatever you would like the installation namespace to be.
We recommend using the default `ngrok-operator` namespace unless you need to change that.

```bash
export NAMESPACE=ngrok-operator
```
